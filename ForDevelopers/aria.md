### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

**Definition:** ARIA is a set of HTML roles and attributes developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enhance the accessibility of web content and applications, especially for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers[1][2][5].

**Purpose:**
- **Accessibility Enhancement:** ARIA attributes provide additional semantic information about elements, helping assistive technologies interpret dynamic content and user interface components[3][6].
- **Roles and Attributes:** ARIA defines roles (e.g., "button", "alert") and attributes (e.g., "aria-label", "aria-hidden") to describe the purpose and state of elements[2][7].
- **Usage Guidelines:** ARIA should be used when native HTML elements do not provide sufficient accessibility support. It is important to use native HTML elements whenever possible, as they inherently support accessibility features[4][6].

### Semantic HTML

**Definition:** Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements according to their intended purpose, providing meaningful context to both browsers and developers[3].

**Purpose:**
- **Improved Accessibility:** Semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) inherently convey meaning and structure, making it easier for assistive technologies to navigate and interpret content[3].
- **SEO Benefits:** Proper use of semantic HTML can improve search engine optimization by clearly defining the structure and hierarchy of content.
- **Maintainability:** Using semantic elements makes code more readable and maintainable by providing clear context about the role of each element in the document.

**Key Differences:**
- **Native Support vs. Supplementation:** Semantic HTML provides built-in accessibility features, while ARIA supplements these features when additional complexity is needed[3][6].
- **Use Cases:** Use semantic HTML for basic structure and ARIA for enhancing accessibility in complex, interactive applications where native HTML falls short[4][5]. 

By combining ARIA with semantic HTML, developers can create web applications that are both accessible and user-friendly, ensuring a better experience for all users.

**Enriched Context Generation: ARIA and Semantic HTML**

**What is ARIA?**

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of HTML roles and attributes developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enhance web content and applications for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.

**Purpose of ARIA:**

- **Enhance Accessibility:** ARIA provides additional semantic information about elements, allowing assistive technologies to interpret dynamic content and user interface components.
- **Define Roles and Attributes:** By defining roles (e.g., "button", "alert") and attributes (e.g., "aria-label", "aria-hidden"), ARIA helps clarify the purpose and state of elements for developers and users alike.

**Why Use ARIA?**

ARIA is particularly useful when:

* Native HTML elements do not provide sufficient accessibility support.
* You need to create complex, interactive applications where native HTML falls short.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Improved Accessibility:** By using semantic HTML (which inherently conveys meaning) and ARIA, you can create a better user experience for all users.
- **SEO Benefits:** Proper use of semantic HTML can improve search engine optimization by clarifying the structure and hierarchy of content.
- **Maintainability:** Using semantic elements makes code more readable and maintainable.

**When to Use ARIA:**

* When creating complex, interactive applications that require native support.
* When you need to enhance accessibility in cases where additional complexity is required.
