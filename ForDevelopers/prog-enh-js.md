You're right, I should have included those important nuances in the explanation. Here's a revised version that incorporates the key points about Progressive Enhancement in SSR mode:

## How Progressive Enhancement Works in SSR Mode

1. **Core HTML Delivery:** The server generates and sends fully-rendered HTML to the client, providing immediate access to essential content and functionality, even without JavaScript.

2. **Layered Approach:** The application is built in layers, starting with semantic HTML, then adding CSS for styling, and finally JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.

3. **Baseline Functionality:** All core features work using standard HTML elements like forms and links, ensuring usability even without JavaScript.

4. **JavaScript Enhancements:** Once the page loads, JavaScript adds additional interactivity and features, improving the user experience for those with JavaScript enabled.

5. **Fallback Mechanisms:** While the site functions without JavaScript, some features may have simpler fallbacks or alternative implementations.

6. **Semantic HTML Foundation:** The core is built on well-structured, semantic HTML, ensuring accessibility and basic functionality across various devices and browsers.

By implementing Progressive Enhancement in SSR, developers create robust applications that provide a consistent experience across various devices and browsers. The key is that core content and essential functionality remain accessible, even if some advanced features are not available when JavaScript is disabled or unsupported.
